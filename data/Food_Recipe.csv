Vankaya Ulli Karam Recipe - Andhra-Style Spicy Onion Eggplant Curry,"Vankaya Ulli Karam Recipe, also known as Andhra-Style Spicy Onion Eggplant Curry, is a cherished dish from the vibrant South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. This regional favorite highlights tender brinjal (eggplant) cooked in a spicy onion gravy enriched with aromatic spices such as cumin, coriander, and fenugreek.",Andhra,Lunch,Vegetarian,"Small Brinjal (Baingan / Eggplant), Onions, Tomatoes, Garlic, Ginger, Green Chillies, Cumin seeds (Jeera), Methi Seeds (Fenugreek Seeds), Coriander (Dhania) Seeds, Salt, Oil, Coriander (Dhania) Leaves","16 Small Brinjal (Baingan / Eggplant)  2 Onions , chopped  2 Tomatoes , chopped  5 cloves Garlic , finely chopped  1 inch Ginger , finely chopped  3 Green Chillies , slit  1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera)  1 teaspoon Methi Seeds (Fenugreek Seeds)  2 tablespoons Coriander (Dhania) Seeds Salt , to taste Oil , to cook Coriander (Dhania) Leaves , chopped, to garnish",15.0,40.0,"To begin making Vankaya Ulli Karam Recipe, get all the ingredients together and keep ready.Prepare the Eggplants: Gently rinse the small brinjals under running water. Pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel. Using a sharp knife, make two diagonal slits on each eggplant—about three-fourths of the way through—leaving the stalk and crown intact. This helps keep the brinjal pieces whole while allowing the masala to soak in.Gather & Prep Other Ingredients: Chop the onions and tomatoes finely; keep them in separate bowls. Finely mince the garlic and ginger. Slit the green chillies lengthwise. Measure out all the spice seeds (cumin, coriander, fenugreek). Set everything within easy reach on your cooking station.Start the Masala Base: Heat about 2 tablespoons of oil in a kadai (heavy-bottomed pan) over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds. Wait for them to sizzle and become aromatic. Next, stir in the coriander seeds and fenugreek seeds. Sauté these for a few seconds until they release their fragrance (be careful not to burn them).Sauté Ginger & Garlic: Add the finely chopped ginger and garlic to the pan. Stir continuously for about 30–45 seconds, ensuring they do not stick or burn. You will notice a beautiful aroma filling the kitchen.Cook the Onions: Add the chopped onions into the pan. Stir well to coat them in the oil and spices. Lower the heat slightly if necessary, and continue to cook the onions until they soften and turn a light pinkish or translucent color. This step usually takes about 3–5 minutes, depending on your flame and the thickness of the onion pieces.Add Tomatoes & Chillies: Add the chopped tomato and the slit green chillies. Mix well, allowing the tomatoes to break down slightly. Continue cooking for 2–3 minutes. The tomatoes will soften, and their tanginess will begin to merge with the onions.Season & Grind the Masala: Sprinkle in salt to taste. (Remember you’ll be adding salt to the final dish as well, so be mindful not to oversalt). Switch off the flame and allow this cooked mixture to cool down slightly. Transfer everything to a blender or mixer jar and grind it into a smooth paste. If you find it too thick, you can add a tablespoon of water for easier grinding, but be careful not to make it too runny.Stuff the Eggplants: Once the paste is ready, take each slit eggplant and fill the slits generously with the ground masala. Reserve any leftover masala paste, as you will use it when cooking the eggplants.Cook the Stuffed Eggplants: Wipe the same kadai clean or use a fresh one. Heat another 1–2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Gently place the stuffed eggplants into the kadai in a single layer, making sure not to overcrowd them. Carefully spoon any remaining masala paste over and around the eggplants. Cover the kadai with a lid and let the eggplants cook for about 5 minutes on medium-low heat.Slow-Cooking & Stirring: After 5 minutes, remove the lid and stir gently, ensuring the eggplants are not sticking to the bottom. Cover and continue cooking, checking every few minutes, until the brinjals become soft and mushy on the inside but still hold their shape on the outside.This can take about 10–15 minutes total, depending on the size of your brinjals. If you find the masala drying out too quickly, add a splash of water.Conversely, if it seems too watery, cook uncovered to reduce and thicken the gravy.Final Touches: Continue sautéing until the onion-tomato gravy turns a deep brownish hue and the oil begins to separate slightly around the edges. This indicates that the spices and onions have cooked down well, producing a full-bodied flavor. Taste and adjust salt as needed. Once done, turn off the heat.Garnish & Serve: Finish by scattering a generous handful of chopped coriander leaves on top. Serve Vankaya Ulli Karam Recipe (Andhra-Style Spicy Onion Eggplant Curry) piping hot alongside Steamed Rice or Indian breads such as Chapati or Phulka. For a truly complete meal, pair it with Moong Dal Rasam (Pesara Pappu Charu) and a simple Black Chickpea Salad.",https://www.archanaskitchen.com/images/archanaskitchen/1-Author/anusha.pariti-gmail.com/Vankaya_Ulli_Karam__Eggplants_in_onion_gravy.jpg

Mix well. We just want all the dry flour to be wet. The dough will be sticky.Thoroughly clean the counter surface, rub your fingers with little flour, transfer the dough onto the counter and start kneading. Initially it will be sticky. Knead until smooth, soft and shiny.The kneading should be “stretch, fold back” movements. Do not add too much flour while kneading. We need flour just to rub your fingers with in case dough is very difficult to handle. If you add more flour, the naan might not turn soft.Place the dough into a bowl rub oil all over the dough, and cover it with a damp cloth. Set it aside for 1 – 1.5 hours, for the dough to prove. After 1-1.5 hours the dough would have risen and it would be double the size.In a mixer grinder, coarsely blend the almonds and the raisins and keep aside. Optionally add the coconut as well. Once the dough is proven, knock it down (punch it with your fist), this is done to release all the air that would have collected. Gently knead for another 2 minutes.Divide the dough into equal parts (I made 3 large balls). Dust a little flour if needed to roll and press the dough.Sprinkle the dry fruits in the center. Now bring the edges of the peshwari naan to the center sealing the stuffing in the center. Now roll the peshwari naan into any desired shape making sure not to break the stuffing out of the naan.Sprinkle some kalonji over the peshwari naan and may be few almond flakes on top as well.Heat a tawa. Grease it well with ghee. Place the rolled peshwari naan and cook covered on low flame. You will see the naan bubbling up.Turn the peshwari naan the other side and rub ghee generously and cook.Keep turning peshwari naan once in 30 seconds to 1 minute on both sides until all edges are cooked and naan is browned on both sides.Remove the peshwari naan from tawa and again rub ghee generously on top.

Add in tomatoes and saute till it becomes mushy and soft.Add your ground recheado masala and keep sautéing until the raw smell from the masala goes away.
